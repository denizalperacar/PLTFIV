## Parametric Look Up Table For Intersecting Volumes

This is an implementation of the paper "CALCULATION OF THE VOLUME OF INTERSECTION OF A SPHERE AND A CYLINDER BY J. BOERSMA AND W. KAMMINGA" which estimates the intersection of a cylinder with a unit sphere.
This code can be used to create a look up table for the calculation of w using the nondimensionalized sphere, cylinder radius and their distance. In codes related to tomographic reconstruction,
this method can be used to obtain the w_{i,j} in MART and ART methods.
